        <p class="description">My first project in Virtual Reality. The program simulates players joining an active queue in a video game. The player has an ELO rating and Ping. The matchmaker tries to pair matches as evenly as possible. Matches are any number of players vs the same number, XvsX. There is also a graph of all players in queue which shows the matchmaking restrictions which expand the more time players are in queue.</p>
        <p class="techs-used">This project is made in Unity 3D with the Build in Render pipeline. It uses an asset called Virtual Reality Interaction framework for easier VR development. It was built for Oculus (now Meta) Quest 2 but can be put on most VR devices.</p>

        <p class="role">This was one of my first real projects in college and it was done in collaboration with a local Croatian high school. The project does what it&#39;s supposed to but there are many things that could be made better in hindsight. Obviously I know way more about Unity and VR today and looking back there&#39;s a lot of things I would change if I could.</p>
