        <p class="description">Jusuf&#39;s pyramid was my first ever game in Unity. This is where I learned how everything worked and the project ended up being a fun experiment. The game was inspired by a dream one of my friends had. It tells a story about a heroic adventurer uncovering the secrets of an ancient Bosnian pharaoh in his tomb. Inside are many dangers and tough puzzles to conquer.</p>
        <p class="techs-used">Made in Unity with C# and in 3D Built-in Render pipeline. The game uses ProBuilder and Terrain tools for its levels and uses quite a few assets from the Asset store.</p>

        <p class="role">I was team lead for this project so I mostly designed the game, puzzles and layout. I did very little coding for this project and actually learned how to code in Unity in a different project later on. I mostly designed the interior of the pyramid using whatever assets and textures i could find. It was very stressful at the time (especially dealing with Git with Unity) but in hindsight it was quite funny and I learned quite a bit.</p>
