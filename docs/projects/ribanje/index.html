        <p class="description">Ribanje is a short 2D adventure game located on the islands of Hvar, Brač and Korčula. The story is inspired by a Croatian travel and philosophcal novel &#39;Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje&#39; which takes place around the year 1550. and describes the journey and dialogue the writer Petar Hektorovič had with some local fishermen. The game&#39;s objective is the same as in the novel, ferry the writer to the island of Korčula but the game is mixed with some action/fantasy elements culminating in a short adventure and item collection game. The player is tasked with collecting items, talking with the locals and fighting the local wildlife.</p>
        <p class="techs-used">The game uses C# and is developed in Unity with the Built-in Render pipeline. The game is top-down, using Cinemachine for transitions between screens. The player and enemies are hand drawn (Not by me, I cannot draw) and the rest are free tilesets, something I want to change eventually.</p>

        <p class="role">While this project was originally for a project for college, it ended up being a more personal endeavor. I am interested in the history of Dalmatia and have a general interest in this time period. I thought of the setting and idea for the game after one of my friends showed me his drawings of a fisherman. The game was planned to have more islands and more interaction with locals and other forces (Venetians and the Ottomans) and these ideas are fully planned out just not developed due to a lack of time. This was my first 2D game and I learned many aspects of 2D game design such as tilemaps, painting levels, Cinemachine, sprite rendering and animations.</p>
