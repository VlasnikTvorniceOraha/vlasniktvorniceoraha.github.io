        <p class="description">ParKing is a mobile app developed in Flutter using Dart for a college project. It&#39;s used for finding free parking spaces through a connection with an IoT database which communicates directly with sensors on the ground that detect if a car is parked in a parking spot. This app was developed as a proof of concept with one motion detection sensor.</p>
        <p class="techs-used">The app is developed for Android and uses the Flutter framework and Dart as a programming language. It uses a Firebase database for saving information (profiles, preferences...) and is connected to a Thingsboard platform which monitors motion sensor devices and transmits information to the mobile app.</p>

        <p class="role">My role was mostly developing the mobile app, adding functionality to it and connecting it to the Thingsboard platform. I primarily learned how to use the Flutter framework to make apps and how to use Dart as a language. It&#39;s a pretty flexible framework for apps but pretty confusing to get into.</p>
