        <p class="description">Stribor is a 3D first person horror game inspired and based on Croatian/slavic fiction and mythology. The game is set in a corrupted enchanted forest and the player is tasked with restoring the forest to its natural beauty. The player is helped and guided by little gnome-like beings &quot;Domaći&quot; or &quot;Svarožići&quot;. In the forest lurk many enemies that the player has to hide from and evade if he wants to complete his goal.</p>
        <p class="techs-used">The game uses C# and is developed in Unity with the Universal Render Pipeline. It focuses heavily on atmosphere so there was a focus on shading and particle systems (fog, vfx). The game uses some basic models that we made in Blender.</p>

        <p class="role">This project was mainly made for a college subject about game development. In that project I was the team lead, main game designer and programmer. I designed the levels and made most of the mechanics for the game except the terrain, AI and some audio stuff. This was my second 3D project so I had a much better idea at what I was doing and learned how to use shaders, rendering layers, lighting and post processing effects in Unity. I also learned how to deal with Unity&#39;s physics (Annoying!) and some basic UI design. I also made some semi-interesting mechanics such as hiding from enemies, a custom enemy that worked off of player vision and mechanics that changed the AI behaviour depending on the area the player was in.</p>
