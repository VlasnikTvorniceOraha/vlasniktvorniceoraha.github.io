            <p> 
                My name is Jak≈°a Fajs. I am a student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER) currently on my 5th year. My master is in
                Computing - Network Science. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Zagreb and like making video games and similar types of applications and software. Most of my projects during
                my studies were video games made in Unity, 2D, 3D and some in Virtual reality (VR). Besides that I have worked on many other projects for courses in
                lots of programming languages. These include 3D graphics, image editing, web development, mobile app development, data management, AI and general
                software and app development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of these projects are listed on the main page and the technologies and languages I am proficient in are displayed
                on this page. Other than that I like swimming, reading and designing video games, history, adventures (D&D and similar stuff) and I dabble in 3D modeling, photoshop and
                audio editing.
