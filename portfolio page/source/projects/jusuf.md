title: Jusuf's pyramid
layout: project.njk
id: jusuf
shortDesc: 3D adventure/puzzle game set in a Bosnian pyramid
description: Jusuf's pyramid was my first ever game in Unity. This is where I learned how everything worked and the project ended up being a fun experiment. The game was inspired by a dream one of my friends had. It tells a story about a heroic adventurer uncovering the secrets of an ancient Bosnian pharaoh in his tomb. Inside are many dangers and tough puzzles to conquer.
role: I was team lead for this project so I mostly designed the game, puzzles and layout. I did very little coding for this project and actually learned how to code in Unity in a different project later on. I mostly designed the interior of the pyramid using whatever assets and textures i could find. It was very stressful at the time (especially dealing with Git with Unity) but in hindsight it was quite funny and I learned quite a bit.
techsUsed: Made in Unity with C# and in 3D Built-in Render pipeline. The game uses ProBuilder and Terrain tools for its levels and uses quite a few assets from the Asset store.
status: Finished
for: College
learned: Unity basics, basics of game development, most basics really
problems: The dinosaur is braindead.
opinion: Goofy aah game. I HATE the number sliding puzzle.
