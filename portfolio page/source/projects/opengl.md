shortDesc: Basic graphical rendering done in OpenGL
description: This is a collection of OpenGL exercises that were done as a part of some pretty difficult laboratory exercises in college that I felt were pretty interesting. From rendering 2D lines to triangles and then textures and Phong shading I learned the basics of using OpenGL and computer graphics in general.
role: This was the time I figured out that I was interested in making games and computer graphics in general. OpenGL uses GLSL (basically C++) to render triangles and meshes. I learned a lot of cool things like triangle winding order, lighting, texturing, splines and curves, vertex and fragment shaders that helped me out a lot later down the line.
techsUsed: The projects are made in Visual Studio and use C++ as the main language. It also uses RenderDoc to overview the graphics pipeline and read the data sent to the graphics card for debugging.Å¾
status: Finished
for: College
learned: Computer graphics, OpenGL, RenderDoc
problems: None
opinion: This was really difficult to do with no experience, but now it is one of my fondest memories
