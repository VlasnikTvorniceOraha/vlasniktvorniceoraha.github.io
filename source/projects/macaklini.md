shortDesc: Lizards with guns in a 2D arcade multiplayer setting
description: A short arcadey 2D game made in Unity with Netcode for Game Objects. This game was made for a multiplayer game subject in college. It focuses on house lizards using guns and the environment to take control of the house from other lizards. The game is designed to be fast paced and fun. It is inspired by games such as Duck Game and Stick Fight. Up to 4 players control lizards that can stick on walls and shoot each other using various guns such as a revolver, shotgun, uzi, minigun, sniper...  
role: This was the first time I worked on a game with multiplayer aspects and it is a mess. It was quite fun to do but needing to sync everything for all players and making sure the right information was passed to everyone was quite exhausting. Netcode for Game Objects is a decent library for this type of development but was suprisingly laggy and had some input delay. I was the team lead and came up with the concept of lizards having a turf war inside of a house. All of the sprite work is hand drawn. I mostly spent my time making the networking side of this game and it 'works'. I mean it functions just not all of the time. Despite this I learned quite a bit about NGO and multiplayer games in general.
techsUsed: Made in Unity with C# and in 2D. Uses Netcode for Game Objects and RPCs for connectivity between the host and the clients. The rest of the game is a simple physics based shooter with some environmental hazards.
status: Finished
for: College
learned: Multiplayer game development, Netcode for Game Objects, RPCs
problems: Client view is VERY unstable, and certain weapons are kinda buggy
opinion: It was fine for learning multiplayer game development but it's really not that stable. Still quite fun though.
