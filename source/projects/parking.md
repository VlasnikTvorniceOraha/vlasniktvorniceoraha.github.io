shortDesc: IoT based mobile app for parking
description: ParKing is a mobile app developed in Flutter using Dart for a college project. It's used for finding free parking spaces through a connection with an IoT database which communicates directly with sensors on the ground that detect if a car is parked in a parking spot. This app was developed as a proof of concept with one motion detection sensor.
role: My role was mostly developing the mobile app, adding functionality to it and connecting it to the Thingsboard platform. I primarily learned how to use the Flutter framework to make apps and how to use Dart as a language. It's a pretty flexible framework for apps but pretty confusing to get into.
techsUsed: The app is developed for Android and uses the Flutter framework and Dart as a programming language. It uses a Firebase database for saving information (profiles, preferences...) and is connected to a Thingsboard platform which monitors motion sensor devices and transmits information to the mobile app.
status: Completed

problems: Mostly on the Thingsboard side
opinion: it was alright, mobile apps are interesting and Flutter is a nice framework
